                <li>The AQI scale has a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 500. However, values past 500 can still be shown.</li>
                <li>If the sensor is exposed to high levels of dust or large particles, the AQI levels may not return to normal for a while after the source has been removed.</li>
                <li>Sensors like the PMS5003 can only read PM2.5 and PM10 values in whole numbers. Please note that despite the fact that the minute graph is curved to help identify patterns, values between whole numbers cannot occur. </li>
                <li>The official PM2.5 and PM10 AQI values should be recorded according to the 24 hour average graph in accordance to the EPA AQI Technical Sheet.</li> 
        </ul>
